### My dotfiles

#### Installation

Clone this repo somewhere in your home directory (I use `~/.dotfiles`) and run the `install.sh` script.
It will install some debian packages(e.g.: git, emacs etc.) and it will set up some symlinks
in your home directory (e.g: `~/.emacs.d` â†’ `~/.dotfiles/emacs/.emacs.d`).
